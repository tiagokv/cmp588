# UFRGS CMP 588 Master's classes
This is a repository which contains the practical exercises from class CMP588 from Master class in the university UFRGS.

All the exercises contain codes in C++11 and are compiled using g++-5 and the projects managed with CMake.

The *measure* folders usually contains exec file source-codes that output a table in a file, which probably will be analyzed by a Python code (easier to plot and manage). 

The *tests* contain unit tests in Google Test framework.

Sometimes, boost library is used for checking the correctness of a algorithm being check.

Dependencies:

- Boost (Download it and set BOOST_ROOT)
- Google Test (It will download it automatically)

*Parental Advisory*: I'm not an expert with neither CMake, g++ and C++. Hence, probably, you will find a newbie setup but functionable (I hope).
